# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 VBA scripting challenge

Multiple sources were used for my code. I used different in class activities to help me with the first section of code where it loops through the data and outputs the Ticker,Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume. I used the solutions from activity 01Stu_StarsCounter in GitLab to help me create the lastrow function to count the number of rows in the data set. Additionally,the solution for 06-Stu_CreditCardChecker-CellComparison helped me format a majority of the code. Outside reasources such as StackOverflow and Microsoft 365 were also used when I ran into errors, or needed access to certain VBA functions. I used EDUCBA to find multiple excel functions like numberformat., and how to calculate percentages in VBA.

Lastly, my tutor Saad Khan helped me A LOT with this challenge. He pointed out errors that i had originally made in my code, and guided me through how to fix it. He also gave me functions for the conditional formatting, Worksheetfunction.max/min, Worksheetfunction.match, and maxpercentindex.
